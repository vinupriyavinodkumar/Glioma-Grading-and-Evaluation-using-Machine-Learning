# Glioma-Grading-and-Evaluation-using-Machine-Learning

Evaluating the efficiency of machine learning models in glioma grading and assess the influence of race and gender on the prevalence of specific gene mutations. Several machine learning algorithms were employed and additionally, an ensemble model was developed by integrating SVM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest. The study also used statistical methods to evaluate the prevalence of gene mutations across different racial and gender groups.

The Dataset used is obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and is titled as the "Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features Dataset." The dataset is funded by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project, which is a comprehensive resource for cancer genomics research. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be found at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C5R62J.
